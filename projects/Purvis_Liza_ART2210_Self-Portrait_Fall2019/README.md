For this project, I took inspiration from the WPAP style (or Wedhaâ€™s Pop Art Portraits). The style incorporates a cubist approach to the organic forms of faces, producing an illusion of cohesive shapes. I was drawn in by the colors and abstract nature, and wanted to incorporate something similar in my work.  In addition to WPAP, I also wanted to use what I learned in photoshop CC involving drop shadows and highlights. In other words, balancing colors to create an illusion of shade or light. For making a WPAP style portrait, shape placement and color determines the level of coherency and detail that I wanted to achieve. I used a similar color palette (purples and reds), along with a few outliers (brown and flesh tones) to make the piece pop. Furthermore, I also focused on the shape geometry. Since I wanted very specific shapes for the face structure, I often avoided using regular polygons, and instead crafted my own. 

WPAP uses direction of flow as well, in other words, using the shape geometry to allow your eyes to follow the desired path. I accomplished that by using pointed edges for my polygons near the center of the face. Most of the shapes converge at a similar point (Ex: the nose, the lips, the cheek lines, and the chin highlights). I wanted the viewers to notice how each shape counter-balances each other and have their eyes naturally converge onto the center of the face as well. 
 

I wanted to avoid using heavy outlines, as it is my preferred style, and push myself to do something lighter. I only used an outline around the eyes because I wanted it to make sense for  my independent variable to be there, the runny eyeliner. However, I saw that it too can be a focal point for the viewer, despite my intended face geometry, due to how stark in contrast it is to the rest of the piece.
